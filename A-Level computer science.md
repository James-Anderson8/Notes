## Terms 
1. Bus - Wire connecting components
2. Address buss - Sends an address to memory
3. Data bus - Sends data in address
4. Control bus - Sends control signals between system components
5. System bus - All 3 buses collectively
6. Words - Fixed group size of digits
7. ALU
8. ACC
9. CIR - Divides current instruction into opcode and operand
10. MDR - Stores fetched data from memory
11. Opcode - Type of instruction to execute
12. Operand - Has actual data
13. Clock - Switches between 0 and 1 millions of times a second
14. Clock cycle - Time it takes to go from 0 to 1 and back to 1.
15. Pipelining - Multiple different stages of different tasks are processed at once.
16. Von Neumann Architecture - Shared memory and bus for data and instructions
17. Stored program concept - The machine code is executed serially
18. Harvard architecture - Physically separate memory for instructions and data
19. Digital Signal Processing (DSP) - Processing for audio, speech, radio, seismic, sonar and more
20. Embedded system - Special purpose computers built into devices
21. CISC - Complex Instruction Set Computer, has a large instruction set. A single instruction is used for many tasks.
22. RISC - Reduced Instruction Set Computer, simple instructions, each taking 1 clock cycle.
23. QR codes - Quick Response codes, can hold more info than bar codes
24. Laser scanner - To read barcodes, a laser is used as a light source. (These are used in supermarkets)
25. Camera-based reader - Uses an imaging scanner to decode. (These are used in phones)
